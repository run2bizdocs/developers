# Webservices for use on CITSmart

This document is intended to provide guidance regarding the Web Services made available for integration with CTSmart ITSM Service Management.

Web Services have been created in CTSmart for inclusion, updating, consultation and cancellation of service requests (incidents and requisitions).


## Before getting started


1.  Before any CITSmart REST operation is used, the user must be authenticated.
2.  Authentication is done through the REST login operation in the URL **/services/login**, which receives a **CtLogin** object containing the **userName**, **password**, and **platform** attributes.
3.  The platform attribute must contain the ID of the site that is requesting the service.
4.  The login operation returns an alphanumeric value in the **SessionID** attribute. This same **SessionID** must be used in the other REST calls. The returned object contains the code and description of the error in case of problems in executing the login operation.
5.  The authenticated user composes the key for data synchronization, when the **synchronize** attribute is set to **true**.
6.  Request inclusion and update services rely on the **synchronize** attribute. When this attribute is **true**, the user registration and catalog services are automatically created or updated in CITSmart from the information sent in the Web Service request.

!!! Abstract "RULE"

    All REST services created in CITSmart receive an input object and return an
    object. In case of error, the return object contains the code and
    description of the error. When there is no error, in addition to the
    attributes defined for each service, the return object contains the date and
    time of execution and the id of the operation. CITSmart ensures that every
    request is recorded in its database and an operation ID is returned to the
    requester, even in case of error.


## Actions


### Create a Ticket

!!! example "Creating a Request /Incident"
    ```tab="URL"
    /services/request/create
    ```

    ```tab="Input Attributes"
    -synchronize - indicates whether the user and / or service information will be synchronized.
    -sourceRequest - request information from the CtRequest class, containing:
     -numberOrigin - the request number in the source system (mandatory. This attribute is required for CITSmart to keep FROM-TO between its database and the original source system number.
     -type - request type (required). Possible values: I = Incident or R = Request.
     -description - description of the incident or request (required).
     -userID - applicant's user ID (required). It will be included if it does not exist in the Citsmart database and the synchronize attribute is equal to true.
     -contact - data of the applicant. Required when the requestor does not exist in CITSmart and the synchronize attribute is equal to true).
     -name - applicant name (required).
      -phoneNumber - applicant's phone number (required).
      -e-mail - applicant's e-mail (required).
      -contractID - contract number in CITSmart (optional). If not informed, Citsmart will include the request linked to the default contract parameterized in the service.
      -service - service data (optional). If not informed, Citsmart will include the request linked to the default service parameterized in the WebService registry.
          -code - service code. Optional, if service name is given).
          -name - service Name. Required when the service does not exist in CITSmart and the synchronize attribute is true.
          -category - category of service. Required when the service does not exist in CITSmart and the synchronize attribute is true.
             -code - category code.
             -name - category name.
      -urgency - urgency of the request (optional). Possible values: H = High, M = Average, L = Low. If not informed, the urgency will be calculated from the CITSmart service catalog parameters.
      -impact of request (optional). Possible values: H = High, M = Medium, L = Low. If not informed, the impact will be calculated from the CITSmart service catalog parameters.
      -groupId - execution group acronym in CITSmart (optional). If not informed, the executor group will be obtained from the CITSmart service catalog parameters.
    ```

    ```tab="Output Attributes"
    Output Attributes are composed of all Input Attributes of the CtRequest class plus the following information:
      number - number of the request created in CITSmart.
      startSLA - SLA start date and time.
      endSLA - SLA end date and time.
      status - status of the request, containing:
         code - code of the situation.
         name - name of the situation.
      currentTask - current task, containing:
         number - task number
         name - name of the task.
         startDateTime - start date and time
         status - task status, containing:
            code: code of the situation.
            name: name of the situation.
      userId - login of the user responsible for the task.
      groupId - acronym of the group responsible for the task.
    ```

    ```JSON tab="JSON Example"
    {"Synchronize": true, 
    "sourceRequest": {"numberOrigin": "9999", 
    "type": "R", 
    "userID": " 61 84460708 ",
    " email ":" fulano.de.tal@centralit.com.br ",

    " category ": {" name ":" Category 1 "}},
    " contractID ":" 1 ",
    " urgency " : "H", 
    "impact": "H"}
    }
    Assuming that the platform attribute in the login was informed by user and considering the synchronize attribute equal to true, the CITSmart will:
      - Check if there is an FROM-TO of contract 1 for the "user";
      - Include the applicant in the user registry, if it does not exist in the database;
      - Include the service in the service catalog of contract 1, if it does not exist in the database and register the service FROM-TO for the client;
      - Include request with source number 9999;
      - Register the DEPUT from the 9999 source request to the client.
    ```
