Validate if requester has permission to register a request with the chosen activity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This webservice allows CITSmart to validate whether the ticket requesters is allowed to register 
a request with an activity defined by them.

Preconditions
----------------

- Configure WebService Operation: request_create

- Configure contracts, groups, flows and permissions.

How to access it
-----------------

1. Access the URL: /citsmart/services/request/create

Procedure
------------------

1. It's necessary to configure in the Webservice "request_create":

    - service property name must have the name of an activity that is active and in production in the portfolio;
    
    - the syncronize property must be true for a user to be registered;
    
    - parameter 45 - LDAP - ID Default Group must be configured with a group that has permission to record requests 
    in the group, contract, and flow of requests that will be registered.
    
    !!! warning "ATTENTION"
    
        A method has been added, which registers the new user to the group set in parameter.45 = LDAP - Default Group ID, 
        which is registered at the time WebServide request_create is started.This way, the new employee receives the 
        permission settings from this group.
        
    - the numberOrigin field must be completed in sequentially, as there is a validation that prevents the registration of 
    a request when the ticket sends an already sent numberOrigin;
    
2. Some settings in this WebService should be as follows: 

    - synchronize":true,
    
    - Service must have the property: "name": "Failure - Event Mgmt.";
